## Objective
The objective of this data exploration was to explore in-season metrics that would be helpful in assessing the health of the GKC populations, both within each management area and regionally. 

Fish ticket data was used for any analysis that involved reported harvest in lbs, since this is only available on fish tickets.  Logbook data was used for analysises that involved CPUE, since logbooks are the most accurate record of catch in numbers and effort (pots pulled). 

## Southeast Regional GKC
While the GKC fishery is managed by area, initial examinations of harvest were done using the entire region.  Recent regional harvest has declined the last six season (Figure 1), with the last three seasons (2014, 2015, 2016) being well below both the historic average 506,918 lb (1980-2016, blue line) and the recent average 453,564 lb (1997 - 2016, red line). 
The fishery is managed seperately for each of seven management areas.  The majority of the harvest, historically, has come from East Central, Mid-Chatham, and Northern areas (Figure 2).

### Cumulative harvest over first 14 or 21 days of fishery
The harvest of GKC was consistent from 2000 to about 2012 or 2013.  This time series allows for an examination of different periods in the fisheries history.  For example, the early 2000s can be seen as a rebuilding time period,  peak harvest occured in the late 2000s, and then harvest started to decline in 2012/2013.  Graphically viewing cumulative harvest over time allows for visualization of the slope of the cumulative harvest over time, which illustrates the differences between "good" and "bad" years (Figures 3 and 4). Visualizing cumulative harvest may be a method to determining how a season will perform but it does not take into account effort (either in boats or pots), so that is a downside to this metric.

An attempt to correct for the amount of effort in each season was performed by dividing the cumulative harvest for each day by the cumulative number of boats (Figure 5).  However, this appears to removed the trends in slope that were present, so this may not be the best measure of effort. Maybe using pots pulled each day would be better?

### Pounds per boat per day - by Management area
The number of pounds landed per boat per day has been used as a proxy for CPUE during in-season management decisions (Figure 6).  The thought is that this statistic takes into account the effort, in number of boats participating in the season, and the duration of the season.  For example, if the GHL was reached quickly this value would be high since the season length would be a small number of days. Currently, this metric is calculated as a summation of the season - the total harvest divided by the season length (in days) and then further divided by the number of vessels participating in the season.  This metric is helpful when comparing seasons once the fishery is complete, but since it uses season length can be skewed when used for in season management since the currrent season is ongoing.  Additionally, this metric is summed over the entire season so it does not capture the variability that is occuring throughout the season.  

Another approach, similar to this one, was to look at the pounds per boat per day for just the first 14 or 21 days of the fishery.  The was attemped but the variablity was high and there were not patterns between "good" harvest years and "poor" harvest years (like those seen with cumulative harvest).

### Logbook CPUE 
Logbook CPUE is another inseason metric that can be used in the first month of the fishery to compare the current seasons progress to previous years.  Although CPUE does NOT take into account soak time, taking the average CPUE over a first month of the fishery (based on logbook data entries) does account the variability among boats and days.  Additionally, CPUE, in terms of legal crab caught per pot, does adequately acknowlege the amount of effort put forth from the fleet.  Ideally the number of pots and soak time would provide full coverage all the effort put forth.  In addition to visually displaying the average CPUE for the first month of the fishery, Figure 7 also has the mean CPUE from 2000 - 2016 (black line) and 20% of this mean (red line).
